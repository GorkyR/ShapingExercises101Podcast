				<p><strong>Welcome to the Shaping Exercises 101 podcast!</strong></p>
				<p>No, it&#39;s not about fitness and gym tips (apparently). It&#39;s an analysis podcast for the web serial (and soon book trilogy) Mother of Learning, written by Domagoj Kurmaic, featuring rational actors trapped in a timeloop!</p>
				<p>Griffin is a seasoned, multiple-time reader and fan of the work, who will acompany Gorky through a first-time read, and they&#39;ll discuss a few chapters every week.</p>
				<p>Hear them say hi in this very, very short teaser, and tune in next week for the first episode, in which we&#39;ll be discussing chapters 1‚Äì3:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Good Morning Brother</li>
					<li>Life&#39;s Little Problems</li>
					<li>The Bitter Truth</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You can read Mother of Learning in <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning">Royal Road</a> and <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning">FictionPress</a>.</p>
				<p>You can chat with us on <a href="https://discord.gg/k78uQ5g7cz">Discord</a>. <del>And leave us comments, questions, and suggestions on <a href="https://github.com/GorkyR/ShapingExercises101Podcast/issues/1">Github</a>. üòÖ</del></p>
				<p>Until next week! üëã</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Notes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Yes, we know that Lord of the Rings takes place over 3 years. Griffin's girlfriend already chastised him for that mistake.</li>
					<li>We're both total newbs to podcasting, audio editing, and at least one of us to public speaking <s>(and speaking in general)</s>. Please excuse awkwardness, nervousness, fumbles, with this in mind for the first couple episodes üôè</li>
					<li>The intro (and the outro) is an edit of one of the songs from Groundhog Day's OST: &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/l1ryj5G30NE">Sometimes People Just Die</a>&quot;, by George Fenton</li>
				</ul>
